Generally speaking,
the Vim documentation should apply
as much for Six as it does for Vim
as far as operators and motions are concerned.
Motions and operators in Six aim to be
bug-for-bug compatible with Vim.

Six strives to be as close to Vim
as the Sublime Text API permits.

Six does not currently implement every single Vim feature,
but is designed to eventually become a comprehensive port.

The current focus of Six is
normal mode, visual and visual line modes,
and a subset of command-line mode.

Additionally, Six implements modes and features
that let you take advantage of unique Sublime Text features,
like multiple selections,
while keeping in with Vim principles.
