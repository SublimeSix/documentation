Sublime Six (or 'Six' for short) is implemented as a Python plugin
without any external dependencies.

The easiest way to install Six
is through [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/),
a package manager for Sublime Text.

To install Six,
look for the [Six](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Six) package in Package Control
and install it.

After installing Six,
restart Sublime Text.
Six should then load
and enter normal mode.
